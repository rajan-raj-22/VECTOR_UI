Method of Determination of Mathematical Reserves : \\n\\n(1) Mathematical Reserves shall be determined for each contract by a prospective method of valuation in \\n\\naccordance with sub-paras (2) to (4) \\n\\n(2) The valuation method shall take into account all prospective contingencies under which any premiums \\n\\n(by the policyholder) or benefits (to the policyholder/beneficiary) may be payable under the policy, as \\n\\ndetermined by the policy conditions.  The level of benefits shall take into account the reasonable \\n\\nexpectations of policyholders (with regard to bonuses, including terminal bonuses, if any) and any \\n\\nestablished practices of an insurer for payment of benefits. \\n\\n(3) The valuation method shall take into account the cost of any options and guarantees that may be \\n\\navailable to the policyholder under the terms of the contract.  \\n\\n(4)  The determination of the amount of liability under each policy shall be based on prudent assumptions of \\n\\nall relevant parameters. The value of each such parameter shall be based on the insurers expected \\n\\nexperience and shall include an appropriate margin for adverse deviations (hereinafter referred to as MAD) \\n\\nthat may result in an increase in the amount of mathematical reserves. \\n\\n(5) (a) The amount of mathematical reserve in respect of a policy, determined in accordance with sub-\\n\\npara (4), may be negative (called negative reserves) or less than the surrender value available (called \\n\\nsurrender value deficiency reserves) at the valuation date.  \\n\\nExplanation: The surrender value for this purpose shall be higher of special surrender value and \\n\\nguaranteed surrender value. \\n\\n(b)  The Appointed Actuary shall, for the purpose of section 35 of the Act,  use the amount of such \\n\\nmathematical reserves without any modification; \\n\\n(c)  The Appointed Actuary shall, for the purpose of sections 13,  49, 64V and 64VA of the Act,  set \\n\\nthe amount of such mathematical reserve to zero, in case of such negative reserve, or to the \\n\\nsurrender value, in case of  such surrender value deficiency reserves, as the case may be \\n\\n(6) The valuation method shall be Gross Premium Valuation  except for the following cases: \\n\\n(a)  One year renewable group term assurances including riders attached to group business wherein \\n\\nReserves shall allow for Unearned Premium, Premium deficiency and Incurred But Not Reported \\n\\nclaims. \\n\\n(b)  Riders attached to individual products wherein the reserve shall be higher of Gross Premium \\n\\nValuation Reserve and Unearned Premium Reserve.  \\n\\n(7) For individual business, the Appointed Actuary may hold additional reserve in respect of   Incurred But \\n\\nNot Reported claims.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 15 ---\\n\\n14  \\n\\n     THE   GAZETTE   OF  INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \\n\\n             [PART IIISEC. 4] \\n\\n \\n\\n(8) If in the opinion of the Appointed Actuary, a method of valuation other than the Gross Premium \\n\\nMethod of valuation is to be adopted, then, other approximation methods (e.g. retrospective method) \\n\\nmay be used. \\n\\nProvided that the amount of calculated reserve is expected to be at least equal to the amount that \\n\\nshall be produced by application of Gross Premium Method. \\n\\n(9) The method of calculation of the amount of liabilities and the assumptions for the valuation \\n\\nparameters shall not be subject to arbitrary discontinuities from one year to the next. \\n\\n3.  Policy Cash Flows: The gross premium method of valuation shall discount the following future policy cash \\n\\nflows at an appropriate rate of interest,  \\n\\n(1)  premiums payable, if any, benefits payable, if any, on death; benefits payable, if any, on survival; \\n\\nbenefits payable, if any, on voluntary termination of contract, and the following, if any, :- \\n\\n(a) basic benefits,  \\n\\n(b) rider benefits, \\n\\n(c) bonuses that have already been vested as at the valuation date,  \\n\\n(d) bonuses as a result of the valuation at the valuation date, and \\n\\n(e) future bonuses (one year after valuation date) including terminal bonuses (consistent with \\n\\nthe valuation rate of interest); \\n\\n(2)  commission and remuneration payable, if any, in respect of a policy (this shall be based on current \\n\\npractice of the insurer). No allowance shall be made for non-payment of commission in respect of \\n\\norphaned policies.  \\n\\n(3)  policy maintenance expenses, if any, in respect of a policy, as provided under sub-para (4) of para 5; \\n\\n(4)  allocation of profit to shareholders, if any, where there is a specified relationship between profits \\n\\nattributable to shareholders and the bonus rates declared for policyholders \\n\\nProvided that allowance must be made for tax, if any. \\n\\n4.  Policy Options and Guarantees: Where a policy provides built-in options that may be exercised by the \\n\\npolicyholder, such as conversion or addition of coverage at future date(s) without any evidence of good \\n\\nhealth, or guarantees, such as annuity rate guarantees at maturity of contract, investment guarantees etc., the \\n\\ncosts of such options or guarantees shall be estimated and treated as special cash flows in calculating the \\n\\nmathematical reserves. \\n\\n5.  Valuation Parameters: \\n\\n(1) \\n\\nThe valuation parameters shall constitute the bases on which the future policy cash flows shall be \\n\\ncomputed and discounted.   Each parameter shall have to be appropriate to the block of business to \\n\\nbe valued.  An Appointed Actuary shall take into consideration the following, \\n\\n (a) The value(s) of the parameter shall be based on the insurers experience study, where \\n\\navailable.  If reliable experience study is not available, the value(s) can be based on the \\n\\nindustry study, if available and appropriate. If neither is available, the values may be based on \\n\\nthe bases used for pricing the product.  In establishing the expected level of any parameter, \\n\\nany likely deterioration in the experience shall be taken into account; \\n\\n(b) The expected level, as determined in clause (a) of this sub-para, shall be adjusted by an \\n\\nappropriate Margin for Adverse Deviations (MAD), the level of MAD being dependent on the \\n\\ndegree of confidence in the expected level, and such MAD in each parameter shall be based \\n\\non the Actuarial Practice Standards / Guidance Notes issued by the Institute of Actuaries of \\n\\nIndia, with the concurrence of the Authority \\n\\n(c) The values used for the various valuation parameters should be consistent among \\n\\nthemselves. \\n\\n(2) \\n\\nMortality rates to be used shall be by reference to a published table, unless the insurer has \\n\\nconstructed a separate table based on its own experience: \\n\\nProvided that such published table shall be made available to the insurance industry by the Institute of \\n\\nActuaries of India, with the concurrence of the Authority.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 16 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n\\nProvided further that such rates determined by reference to a published table shall not be less than one \\n\\nhundred percent of that published table. \\n\\nProvided further that such rates determined by reference to the published table may be less than one \\n\\nhundred percent of that published table if the Appointed Actuary can justify a lower percent. \\n\\n(3) Morbidity rates to be used shall be by reference to a published table, unless the insurer has constructed \\n\\na separate table based on its own experience:  \\n\\nProvided that such published table shall be made available to the insurance industry by the Institute of \\n\\nActuaries of India, with the concurrence of the Authority: \\n\\nProvided further that such rates determined by reference to a published table shall not be less than one \\n\\nhundred percent of that published table. \\n\\nProvided further that such rates determined by reference to the published table may be less than one \\n\\nhundred percent of that published table if the Appointed Actuary can justify a lower percent. \\n\\n (4) Policy maintenance expenses shall have regard to the actual expense experience of the insurer. All \\n\\nexpenses shall be increased in future years for inflation; the rate of inflation assumed should be consistent \\n\\nwith the valuation rate of interest. \\n\\nProvided that appropriate additional provisions shall be made if the actual experience has not been \\n\\nconsidered for the valuation. \\n\\nProvided further that the above provision shall not be applicable to the life insurance companies for the \\n\\nfirst five years from the date of commencement of the business. \\n\\n(5) Valuation rate of interest, to be used by Appointed Actuary - \\n\\n(a) for the calculation of the present value of policy cash flows referred to in para 3, shall not \\n\\nbe higher than the rates of interest, determined from prudent assessment of the yields \\n\\nfrom existing assets attributable to blocks of life insurance business, and the yields which \\n\\nthe insurer is expected to obtain from the sums to be invested in the future, and such \\n\\nassessment shall take into account-  \\n\\n(i) the composition of assets supporting the liabilities, expected cash flows from the \\n\\ninvestments on hand, the cash flows from the block of policies to be valued, the likely \\n\\nfuture investment  conditions and the reinvestment and disinvestment strategy to be \\n\\nemployed in dealing with the future net cash flows; \\n\\n(ii) the risks associated with investment in regard to receipt of income on such investment \\n\\nor repayment of principal; \\n\\n(iii) the expenses associated with the investment functions of the insurer; \\n\\nb) shall not be higher than, for the calculation of present value of policy cash flows in respect \\n\\nof a particular category of contracts, the yields on assets maintained for the purpose of such \\n\\ncategory of contacts; \\n\\nc) in respect of non-participating business, shall recognize the risk of decline in the future \\n\\ninterest rates; \\n\\nd) in respect of participating business, shall be based on the assumption (with regard to \\n\\nfuture investment conditions), that the scale of future bonuses used in the valuation is \\n\\nconsistent with the valuation rate of interest.   \\n\\n(6) Lapse rate, if considered for valuation, should be a prudent assumption based on past experience of the \\n\\nproduct or similar products; and shall have regard to the expected future experience based on the nature of \\n\\nthe products, target market, distribution channel etc.  \\n\\n(7) Other parameters may be taken into account, depending on the type of policy. In establishing the values \\n\\nof such parameters, the considerations set out in this Schedule shall be taken into account.    \\n\\n(8) Reinsurance arrangement with an element of borrowing in the form of deposit or credit of any kind from \\n\\ninsurers reinsurers without the prior approval of the Authority shall not be treated as credit for reinsurance \\n\\nfor the purpose of determination of required solvency margin.  \\n\\n(9) In case the mathematical reserve is calculated allowing for outgo in respect of reinsurance premium and \\n\\ncredit taken for claim recoveries from reinsurer, the valuation basis and methods shall be as per this \\n\\nschedule.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 17 ---\\n\\n16  \\n\\n     THE   GAZETTE   OF  INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \\n\\n             [PART IIISEC. 4] \\n\\n \\n\\n6.

Failure on the part of an employee to so \\n\\ninform his Reporting Officer/Competent Authority will be regarded as suppression of material \\n\\ninformation and will render him liable to disciplinary action on this ground alone, apart from the action \\n\\nthat will be taken on the outcome of the police case against him. \\n\\n(3)  Where a penalty of dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement from service imposed upon an \\n\\nemployee under  suspension is set aside under  these Regulations and the case is remitted for  further \\n\\ninquiry or action or with any other directions,  the order of his suspension shall be deemed to be in force, \\n\\non and from the date of original order of dismissal  or  compulsory retirement  and shall remain  in force  \\n\\nuntil  further orders. \\n\\n(4) Where a penalty of dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement from service imposed upon an \\n\\nemployee is set aside or declared or rendered  void in consequence of or by a decision of a court  of law \\n\\nand the Competent Authority, on  consideration of the circumstances of the case, decides to hold further \\n\\ninquiry against him on the allegations on which the penalty of dismissal, removal  or compulsory \\n\\nretirement was originally imposed, the employee  shall  be deemed  to  have  been  placed  under  \\n\\nsuspension  by  the Competent Authority from the date of the original order of dismissal, removal or \\n\\ncompulsory retirement and shall continue to remain  under  suspension until  further orders:\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 139 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n139 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nProvided that no such further inquiry shall be ordered unless it is intended to meet a situation where the \\n\\ncourt has passed an order purely on technical grounds without going into the merits of the case. \\n\\n(5)(a) An order of suspension made or deemed to have been made under  this Regulation shall continue to \\n\\nremain in force until it is modified or revoked by the Competent Authority. \\n\\n(b) Where an employee is suspended or is deemed to have been suspended (whether in connection with  \\n\\nany disciplinary proceeding  or otherwise), and any other disciplinary proceeding is commenced  against \\n\\nhim during the period of that suspension, the Competent Authority to place him under suspension may, \\n\\nfor  reasons to be recorded  by him in writing, direct  that the employee  shall  continue to  be under  \\n\\nsuspension  until  termination of all or any of such proceedings. \\n\\n(c) An order of suspension made or deemed to have been made under this Regulation may at any time be \\n\\nmodified or revoked by the Competent Authority who had made or is deemed to have made the order.  \\n\\n(d) During the period of suspension, an employee shall not enter the work-place/office premises except \\n\\nwith the written permission of the Competent Authority, nor shall he leave station without the written \\n\\npermission of the Competent Authority.

The pay and \\n\\nallowances so determined shall not be less than the subsistence allowance already paid to the employee.  \\n\\nWhere a penalty of dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement from service imposed upon an \\n\\nemployee under suspension is set aside in appeal or review under these Regulations, the period of \\n\\nsuspension shall be treated as a period spent on duty for all purposes.  \\n\\nIn cases other than those falling under sub-regulation (2) and (3), the employee shall, subject to the \\n\\nprovisions of sub-regulation (7) and (8), be paid such amount (not being the whole) of pay and \\n\\nallowances to which he would have been entitled had he not been suspended, as the Competent \\n\\nAuthority may determine, after observing the procedure of issuing show cause notice and consideration \\n\\nof representation, if any, submitted by the employee.

Powers to issue instructions  \\n\\n(1) The Chairperson may, from time to time, issue such instructions as may be necessary to give effect \\n\\nto the implementation of these provisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 163 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n163 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of any of the provisions mentioned herein, such \\n\\ninstructions may provide for the basis for detailed allocation of marks for written examination, \\n\\nseniority, qualification, ACRs,  Interview, track record (leave) within the ceiling mentioned under \\n\\nthese rules. \\n\\n \\n\\nSchedule VII \\n\\nSensitive posts and transfers \\n\\n1. Sensitive posts \\n\\n(1) Sensitive post means a post which is considered as a key decision-making as also that involving \\n\\nfinancial sanctions.  The nature of posts differs on the importance, the type of information and \\n\\nresponsibilities that are attached to them. The positions involving settlement of bills/financial \\n\\nsanctions would be classified as sensitive.  \\n\\n(2) The Chairperson has power to classify a post as a sensitive post and circulate the list of such posts \\n\\nfrom time to time.  \\n\\n(3) Guiding principles in dealing with sensitive posts \\n\\n(a) While all employees are ordinarily considered for transfer after 5 years, those employees \\n\\nworking in sensitive posts/departments shall be compulsorily rotated / transferred once every 3 \\n\\nyears.   \\n\\n(b) Transfer of any employee working in a sensitive post/department, before completion of \\n\\nminimum period on a post, will be done in public interest after recording reasons therefor. \\n\\n(c) Considering the nature and importance of the posts identified as sensitive, while determining \\n\\nplacements, postings and transfers of employees positioned in these posts will be decided \\n\\naccordingly.   \\n\\n(d) First posting on appointment / promotion of employees shall be to a non-sensitive post.  \\n\\n(e) There shall be a gap of minimum 3 years between one sensitive posting to another. \\n\\n(f) An employee in the subsequent cycle of posting shall not be posted in the same sensitive post.  \\n\\n2. Transfers \\n\\n(1) Objective \\n\\nTransfers are integral to any Organization striving to achieve its organizational goals.  They are \\n\\nnecessary for employees so as to have exposure to various areas of working in the organization.  \\n\\nThe following objectives shall guide the provisions on transfer:- \\n\\n(a) To match the Authoritys objectives and goals with individual aspirations. \\n\\n(b) To align with Regulations 5 (9) and 15 of the IRDAI Staff (Officers and other Employees) \\n\\nRegulations, 2016 in building a work force fully engaged in the performance of their duties. \\n\\n(c) To have the right person in the right place by identifying skills and aptitudes of employees to meet \\n\\norganizational needs.   \\n\\n(d) To identify and groom employees for taking positions in higher rank. \\n\\n(e) To implement CVC guidelines in the matter of transfer/ rotation of employees in sensitive posts. In \\n\\naddition, such transfer/rotation of employees can be considered for all positions to make \\n\\nemployees more knowledgeable and empowered in developing the organization.  \\n\\n(f) \\n\\nTo provide an opportunity to employees to improve their personal development and career.  \\n\\n(g) To effect promotions. \\n\\n(h) To bring in transparency in the movement of employees in the organization after lapse of a \\n\\nspecified period.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 164 ---\\n\\n164  \\n\\n     THE   GAZETTE   OF  INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \\n\\n             [PART IIISEC. 4] \\n\\n(2) Applicability \\n\\nThe transfers may be made in all grades of employees of the Authority including Officers on Special \\n\\nDuty (OSD).  \\n\\n3. Type of transfers \\n\\nThere will be three types of transfers: \\n\\n(1) Request transfers \\n\\n(a) Request Transfer means such transfer for which an order is issued by the Competent Authority \\n\\nconsidering the request of an employee for his posting at a station of his choice. \\n\\n(b) Qualifying service for request transfer will be the number of years of stay at one station at a \\n\\nsingle stretch, to be reckoned from the date of joining at such station. However, if an employee \\n\\navails leave beyond 120 days including all kinds of leave in a year, such period will not be \\n\\ncounted as qualifying service for request transfer. \\n\\n(c) Transfer on request of an employee may be considered on medical emergency/grounds or other \\n\\ngenuine personal reasons subject to availability of vacancy at that office to which transfer is \\n\\nsought.  \\n\\n(d) Employees with 3 years active service and above can apply for transfer but the employee whose \\n\\nservice is more at that centre will have priority in transfer.   \\n\\n(e) Any transfer due to personal reasons within a minimum term of three years subject to \\n\\nadministrative approvals will be at employees cost.   \\n\\n(2) Administrative transfers \\n\\n(a) Administrative transfer means transfer made without the request of an employee due to office \\n\\nexigencies.  \\n\\n(b) All employees may ordinarily be considered for transfer after 5 years. Employees are eligible for \\n\\nTA, joining time and other applicable allowances/entitlements as per rules in vogue.  \\n\\n(3) Transfers in public interest \\n\\nTransfer of any employee before completing the minimum term of 3 to 5 years in a particular \\n\\ndepartment/station may be made by the Competent Authority in public interest by recording the \\n\\nreasons for such transfers.   \\n\\nNote: The following definitions are relevant in the context of transfers:  \\n\\n(a) Normal period of posting means continuous posting of an employee in the same \\n\\nposition/Department for a period of 3 years and at the same station for a period of 5 years after \\n\\nwhich he becomes due for transfer. \\n\\n(b) Sensitive post means a post which is considered as a key post in the Authority.  \\n\\n(c) Station means the city up to the municipal limits or a territorial area as per the census of India \\n\\nwhere salary and allowances including HRA and CCA are payable.  \\n\\n4. Posting/Stay  \\n\\n(1) The posting of an employee in a department will be generally for three years except in cases of any \\n\\ndisciplinary proceedings initiated/pending. The starting point for computing the stay in a department \\n\\nshall be the date of joining in that department. \\n\\n(2) The stay of an employee at any station for the purposes of transfer will ordinarily be five years \\n\\nsubject to office exigencies and decision of the Competent Authority. This provision, however, does \\n\\nnot apply to Deputy General Manager and above.  \\n\\n(3) When a certain number of employees are due for moving out of a station to a new station or by local \\n\\nrotation to new postings in the same station for the reason of having completed their stay in that \\n\\nstation, but cannot be so moved due to non-availability of vacancies, an employee who has served \\n\\nfor longer period will be transferred first.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 165 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n165 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(4) On request, the Authority will endeavor to transfer an employee to a centre of his choice, one or two \\n\\nyears prior to retirement, subject to administrative convenience and availability of vacancy. \\n\\n(5) Specialized postings - The specialized postings shall be governed by instructions issued in this \\n\\nregard from time to time. For (i) Actuarial Department, (ii) Legal Department (iii) Any other \\n\\nDepartment as decided by the Chairperson depending on the organizational needs - the conditions as \\n\\naforesaid shall be modified to be up to seven years and in case of promotion of employees working \\n\\nin such departments, it may be at the discretion of the Competent Authority depending on exigencies \\n\\nof the department and the instructions issued from time to time.  \\n\\n(6)  The period of stay at a centre will be inclusive of all postings in different departments at that \\n\\ncentre. The transferees will be identified on \\'First-in-First-out basis.   \\n\\n5. Transfers on promotion \\n\\n(1) Refusal of promotion to avoid transfer will be dealt with as per rules which may include cancellation \\n\\nof promotion and non-consideration of his candidature for promotion in the next round of \\n\\npromotions.  \\n\\n(2) Employees aged more than 58 years may be considered for retention in the same station on \\n\\npromotion subject to availability of vacancy at that station.  \\n\\n(3)  Employees on promotion may be posted in the same station subject to the vacancy position, \\n\\nprovided, the employee was transferred from some other station within the last 2 years. \\n\\n6. Consideration of cases before transfers are effected  \\n\\n No relaxation shall be considered except on the following grounds: \\n\\n(1)  Transfer of an employee couple up to the grade of Deputy General Manager will be subject to \\n\\nadministrative convenience. \\n\\n(2)  Posting on compassionate grounds - in case an employee seeks a posting to a particular station on \\n\\nmedical grounds, the Chairperson may take a decision. However, if required, the case may be \\n\\nreferred to a Medical Board for opinion.  \\n\\n7. Using outside influence \\n\\nBringing any outside influence for or against a transfer by an employee or any of his family member(s) \\n\\nwill be treated as a misconduct subject to disciplinary action under IRDAI Staff (Officers and other \\n\\nEmployees) Regulations, 2016.  \\n\\n8. Transfer of employees against whom disciplinary/vigilance cases are pending \\n\\nRequests for transfer received from employees against whom vigilance/non-vigilance complaints/cases \\n\\nhave been registered/contemplated shall not be considered till the cases are decided.  They may be \\n\\nredeployed at the same station. \\n\\n9.  Transfers and postings of employees on deputation to IRDAI as OSDs \\n\\nOSDs from various lending organizations who are selected as OSDs/working as OSDs to the extent \\n\\npossible shall not be posted to sensitive posts during the period of their deputation with IRDAI.  \\n\\nHowever, if it is essential to consider such OSDs being posted to sensitive posts based on their \\n\\nexperience, utility to the organization, etc. they may be considered by the Chairperson for posting in the \\n\\nsensitive posts for a maximum period of two (2) years only. In no case any extension beyond the period \\n\\nof two years will be considered.  \\n\\n10. Relief of employees on transfer \\n\\n(1)All posting orders will indicate a relieving time up to a maximum of 30 days within which an \\n\\nemployee is to be relieved. The relieving shall be mandatorily carried out before the last date indicated.   \\n\\n(2)Representations, if any, will be addressed to the Chairperson only. Any representation in respect of \\n\\nposting orders are to be submitted within 15 days of issue of such orders failing which the same will not \\n\\nbe considered. The representation will be considered by the Competent Authority on a case to case basis \\n\\nand disposed of within 15 days.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 166 ---\\n\\n166  \\n\\n     THE   GAZETTE   OF  INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \\n\\n             [PART IIISEC. 4] \\n\\n(3)Overstay in the post after a transfer order is issued tantamounts to misconduct and necessary action \\n\\nwill be initiated accordingly as per rules and instructions in vogue.   \\n\\n11. Transfer of Senior Officers \\n\\nTransfer of employees in the grade of Deputy General Manager and above will be governed by \\n\\norganizational needs as also suitability for the post in question. \\n\\n12. Miscellaneous  \\n\\nAll transfer orders shall be normally issued immediately coinciding with promotions to the various \\n\\ngrades every year and, in any case, not later than 31st March of the year.  \\n\\nThese are broad provisions governing sensitive posts and transfers and detailed administrative \\n\\ninstructions shall be issued by the Chairperson in terms of the power vested in him vide Regulation 80. \\n\\n \\n\\nSchedule VIII \\n\\nSeniority \\n\\nIn terms of Regulation 14 of the IRDAI Staff (Officers and other Employees) Regulations, 2016, the \\n\\nseniority of employees in the Authority shall be defined as per the following guidelines: \\n\\n Publication of list \\n\\n(1) There shall be a single combined list called seniority list for each grade.  \\n\\n(2) The seniority list for each grade shall be prepared and published as on 1st January of every year.  \\n\\n(3) The seniority list prepared shall be published in the Authoritys intranet. \\n\\n1. Reckoning seniority \\n\\n(1) The principle of an employee appointed as a result of an earlier selection being treated as senior \\n\\nto those appointed as a result of subsequent selection in the same grade in Direct Recruitment \\n\\n(DR) shall be followed for preparing the seniority list. \\n\\n(2) The relative seniority of all direct recruit employees is determined by the order of merit in which \\n\\nthey are selected for such appointment and when they join the service of the Authority on offer \\n\\nof appointment.  \\n\\nHowever, where a candidate seeks time for joining the service and the same is approved by the \\n\\nCompetent Authority, subject to a period not exceeding six months, on joining within the permitted \\n\\nperiod not exceeding six months, the seniority of such candidate shall be in the order of merit in \\n\\nwhich he is selected.  \\n\\nHowever, where a candidate joins the service after the permitted period exceeding six months, \\n\\nseniority of such candidate shall be from the date of  his joining the service in the Authority.     \\n\\n(3) In case of employees selected in response to the same notification for appointment to different \\n\\nposts in the same grade with different qualifications, though the process of selection may be \\n\\ndifferent, a consolidated seniority list shall be maintained in the manner mentioned in Para 4 (c) \\n\\nbelow.  \\n\\n(4) Where a separate merit list is prepared, the following criteria will be followed:  \\n\\n(a) The seniority of an employee shall be determined by the date of selection.  \\n\\n(b) Where the date of selection is same, chronology of offer of appointment shall be the criteria.   \\n\\n(c) Where both (a) and (b) are also same, the seniority of the selected employee shall be determined \\n\\naccording to the principle of rotation of vacancies between different posts.   \\n\\nEg: Where appointments are made to a grade from different streams and if appointment to one \\n\\nstream (Stream A) is made at 50% and from another stream (Stream B) at 50%,  even if through \\n\\nseparate Interview Committees,  the seniority of an employee in that grade shall be determined \\n\\nin the order of A1, B1, A2, B2,....\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 167 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n167 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(5) The available direct recruits and promotees, for assignment of inter-se seniority, would refer to \\n\\nthe direct recruits and promotees who are appointed against the vacancies of a recruitment year.   \\n\\n(6) Recruitment year would be the year of initiating the recruitment process against a vacancy year.  \\n\\n(7) The initiation of recruitment process against a vacancy year would be the date of notification for \\n\\nfilling up of vacancies in case of direct recruits; in the case of promotees the date on which a \\n\\nnotification for promotion is released to fill up the vacancies through promotion would be the \\n\\nrelevant date. \\n\\n(8) Thus, inter-se seniority of direct recruits and promotees shall be fixed on the basis of date of \\n\\ninitiation of process of recruitment irrespective of date of joining within the time given for \\n\\njoining subject to such joining time permitted by Competent Authority.   \\n\\n(9) There shall not be any notional seniority granted with retrospective date.   \\n\\n(10) \\n\\nThere shall not be a separate seniority list for direct recruits and promotees in a particular \\n\\ngrade.  \\n\\n(11) \\n\\nThe relative seniority of an employee in the promoted grade shall be same as in the feeder \\n\\ngrade. However, employees on refusal of promotion or non-promotion will lose seniority and \\n\\nwill be shown in the seniority list of the grade from which he competed. \\n\\n(12) \\n\\nIn case of employees who are under suspension or disciplinary proceedings are in the \\n\\nprogress, their original seniority will not be affected, if completely exonerated or the suspension \\n\\nrevoked. The seniority of an employee reverted to previous grade depends on the order of the \\n\\nCompetent Authority. \\n\\n \\n\\nSchedule IX - A \\n\\n    Deputation  Inward \\n\\n1. The provisions under this schedule are envisaged to have all relevant rules, regulations, and provisions \\n\\npertaining to deputation - inward at one place so that self-dependence, objectivity and transparency can be \\n\\nachieved. The Competent Authority may, due to exigencies of work and to have interaction of experience, \\n\\nwork culture and practices of different organizations, appoint Officers on deputation from other financial \\n\\nregulators, Government departments and PSU Insurers to notified post(s) for a limited period, by the end of \\n\\nwhich they will have to return to their parent cadres. Such an arrangement will enable IRDAI to have \\n\\nexperienced insurance professionals, practices with regard to products, servicing, investment, grievance \\n\\nhandling, etc. The terms and conditions of deputation shall be as laid down by the Competent Authority.  \\n\\nQualifications, maximum age and relevant experience of the Officers to be taken on deputation are \\n\\nprescribed in Schedule IX  B Qualifications, Age and Experience for various posts  Deputation Inward.   \\n\\n2. Identification of posts: While regulatory and supervisory aspects could be developed internally with \\n\\nperiodic and limited lateral inflow, the development entails need of personnel experienced in Insurance \\n\\nbusiness and the intricacies therein for some time. There is, thus a need for officers on deputation so that \\n\\nthere is a continuous flow of personnel coming from the industry, other regulators and Government for \\n\\ndevelopment-orientation.  \\n\\nThe following are some important areas considered for identifying posts on deputation. \\n\\n(a) Statistical /Economic matters and Research \\n\\n(b) Reinsurance \\n\\n(c) Catastrophe modelling \\n\\n(d) Macro-prudential surveillance and early warning signals \\n\\n(e) Risk management \\n\\n(f) Legal jurisprudence \\n\\n(g) Internal audit/Concurrent audit\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 168 ---\\n\\n168  \\n\\n     THE   GAZETTE   OF  INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \\n\\n             [PART IIISEC. 4] \\n\\n(h) ERP/Network management/Analytics \\n\\n(i) Information Security and Governance \\n\\n(j) Any other area as may be determined by the Chairperson. \\n\\n3. Deputation reserve: A deputation reserve of 18% and leave reserve of 2% together not exceeding 20% of \\n\\nsanctioned strength with prior approval of the Authority be utilized for filling the positions on deputation till \\n\\ninternal capability is adequately built.   \\n\\nThe number of vacancies to be filled in by deputation within the deputation reserve as above may be \\n\\nreviewed from time to time based on  \\n\\n(a) non-availability of supplemental personnel within IRDAI possessing requisite qualifications and \\n\\nexperience; and \\n\\n(b) having regard to the role to be  performed by a specific position, it is necessary to provide for \\n\\nofficers on deputation at an appropriate level with a view to injecting fresh knowledge and \\n\\nexperience. \\n\\n4. Determination of analogous posts: The following shall be the criteria for determining whether the posts \\n\\nin question could be treated as analogous to each other:  \\n\\n(a)   Identical scales of pay: Though the scales of pay of two posts which are being compared may not \\n\\nbe identical, they should be such as to be an extension of or a segment of each other. \\n\\n(b)   Same group of posts: Both the posts should be falling in the same group of posts.  \\n\\n(c)    Responsibilities and duties: The levels of responsibility and duties of the two posts should be \\n\\nidentical/comparable.  \\n\\n(d)  Qualifications/Experience: The qualifications and experience of the Officers to be selected should \\n\\nbe as per the schedule and comparable to those for direct recruits/promotees to the post where direct \\n\\nrecruitment/promotion has also been prescribed as one of the methods of appointment.  \\n\\n5. Period of deputation: The maximum period of deputation is three years.  \\n\\n(1) The period of deputation including the period of deputation or contract in another ex-cadre post held \\n\\nimmediately preceding an appointment in the same or some other organisation shall not exceed three \\n\\nyears respectively. However, the terms and conditions of deputation of officers from Government \\n\\nshall be governed by the extant instructions of DOPT. \\n\\n(2) Premature reversion to parent cadre:    As and when a situation arises for premature reversion to the \\n\\nparent cadre of the Officer on deputation, his services could be so returned after giving one months \\n\\nadvance notice to the lending organization and the Officer concerned. \\n\\n(3) The officers who served IRDAI on deputation for one term will not be considered for second term.  \\n\\n(4) The Officer on deputation shall not be considered for any foreign deputation or deputation to any \\n\\norganization within India. \\n\\n(5) Permanent Officers of IRDAI and/or Officers already on deputation cannot apply for higher ex-\\n\\ncadre post at IRDAI as and when advertised for such higher posts. \\n\\n6. \\n\\nSources of procuring Officers on deputation:  \\n\\n(1) The guiding principles shall be determination of analogous posts, public notification of vacancies \\n\\nwith eligibility conditions regarding age, qualification, experience etc. and competitive selection \\n\\nprocess. \\n\\n(2) Financial Regulators/PSU Insurers/Central Government: The vacancy circular shall be circulated \\n\\nthrough advertisements and adequate notice/circulation to all eligible institutions besides publishing \\n\\nit in national newspapers and display of detailed advertisement in IRDAI website. The vacancy \\n\\ncircular/advertisement shall clearly bring out the categories and levels of Officers and their pay \\n\\nscales eligible for consideration including conditions of eligibility, age, number of years of service \\n\\nin a particular grade/scale, qualifications and experience required.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 169 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n169 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7. Ex-cadre post and pay fixation: \\n\\n(1) Given that the pay scales in IRDAI are similar to those of RBI/SEBI, pay parity for analogous posts \\n\\nshall be the determining principle as scales of IRDAI are asynchronous with pay scales of \\n\\nGovernment/PSUs. In order to ensure uniformity in fixation of pay and allowances across Officers \\n\\non deputation including from Government with varying grades/scales/pay, the general principles of \\n\\npay parity for determination of scales shall be considered. In such cases, pay will be fixed by adding \\n\\none increment to the pay in the parent cadre post in the scale of his regular parent post (and if he/she \\n\\nwas drawing pay at the maximum of the scale, by the increment last drawn) and equating the pay \\n\\n(inclusive of grade allowance and other allowances entitled for dearness allowance) so raised plus \\n\\ndearness allowance (and additional or ad hoc dearness allowance, interim relief, etc.. if any) with \\n\\nemoluments comprising of pay plus DA, ADA, interim relief, if any, admissible, in the borrowing \\n\\norganization and the pay will be fixed at the stage in the pay scale of the ex-cadre post in IRDAI at \\n\\nwhich total emoluments admissible in the ex-cadre post in IRDAI as above equal the total \\n\\nemoluments drawn in the parent cadre.  \\n\\n(2) The ex-cadre post and the analogous posts shall be determined in such a manner that basic pay plus \\n\\ngrade pay/allowance, if any, on deputation shall be comparable to the ex-cadre post carrying a pay \\n\\nmatching his current pay.  \\n\\n(3) The ex-cadre post and the analogous posts shall be determined in such a manner that if the equated \\n\\npay and emoluments of analogous post fall in pay scale of two grades in IRDAI, the fixation will be \\n\\nmade for the ex-cadre post for which he/she is selected. \\n\\n8. \\n\\nExercise of option \\n\\n(1) \\n\\nAn Officer appointed on deputation to IRDAI from other organizations, may elect to draw either the \\n\\npay in the scale of pay of deputation post or scale of pay in the parent cadre plus deputation allowance \\n\\nthereon plus personal pay, if any, by exercising his option within 30 days from the date of joining IRDAI. In \\n\\ncase the employee on deputation fails to submit the option within the aforesaid period it shall be deemed that \\n\\nthe employee has opted for the pay in the scale of pay of deputation post in IRDAI and his pay shall be fixed \\n\\naccordingly. The option once exercised by an employee on deputation regarding the pay shall be final.  \\n\\n(2) \\n\\nHowever, an employee may revise the option under the following circumstances which will be \\n\\neffective from the date of occurrence of the same: \\n\\n(i) When he is reverted to a lower grade in the parent cadre; \\n\\n(ii) When the scale of pay of the parent post on the basis of which his emoluments are regulated \\n\\nduring deputation/foreign service or of the ex-cadre post held by the employee on \\n\\ndeputation/foreign service is revised either prospectively or from a retrospective date. \\n\\n(3) \\n\\nRevision in the rates of DA, HRA or any other allowance either in the parent or borrowing \\n\\norganisation shall not be an occasion for revising the option. If the pay of an officer in his cadre post \\n\\nundergoes downward revision for other than disciplinary/vigilance cases, the pay in the ex-cadre \\n\\npost is also liable to be re-fixed on the basis of revised pay and in accordance with the revised option \\n\\nor existing option if the employee does not revise his option. \\n\\n(4) \\n\\nWhen he receives promotion/proforma-promotion or is appointed to non-functional selection grade \\n\\nor up-gradation of scale in the parent cadre, the Officer shall have the option of either continuing \\n\\nwith the existing pay and allowances in the ex-cadre post till the end of deputation or seek \\n\\nrepatriation to claim the benefits of promotion. The pay fixation and reconsideration of ex-cadre \\n\\npost for a higher ex-cadre post shall not be entertained due to promotion in the parent cadre. \\n\\n(5) \\n\\nAn Officer on deputation shall be repatriated to his parent Organization one year prior to his \\n\\nsuperannuation. \\n\\n9. Deputation allowance only if he opts for parent cadre scales:  \\n\\n(1) The deputation (duty) allowance admissible shall be at the rates applicable in the parent organization. \\n\\n(2) IRDAI may allow in addition to deputation (duty) allowance, under special circumstances, any special \\n\\nallowance attached to the post held by the employee in his parent Department. In case special allowance \\n\\nis attached to the scale of pay of the ex-cadre post in IRDAI and the employee has opted to draw pay in\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 170 ---\\n\\n170  \\n\\n     THE   GAZETTE   OF  INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \\n\\n             [PART IIISEC. 4] \\n\\nthat scale, he will also be entitled to draw such special allowance in addition to the pay in that scale. \\n\\nHowever, such special allowance will not be admissible if he has opted to draw pay in the parent cadre \\n\\nscale/grade pay plus deputation (duty) allowance. \\n\\n(3) Personal pay, if any, drawn by an officer in his parent department will continue to be admissible on \\n\\ndeputation if he opts to draw pay in the parent cadre scale/grade pay plus deputation (duty) allowance. \\n\\nNo deputation (duty) allowance on this personal pay will however, be admissible. \\n\\n10. Increments: An employee will draw increment in the parent cadre grade or in the scale of pay/grade \\n\\npay attached to the deputation post as the case may be, depending on the option exercised. The date of \\n\\nnext increment will become due after one year from date of pay fixation on deputation in IRDAI, if he \\n\\nhas opted for pay scale/grade pay of the deputation post. Notional increments shall continue to accrue to \\n\\nhim in the post held on regular basis in the parent cadre/organization for the purpose of regulation of \\n\\npay on repatriation to the parent post at the end of the period of deputation. \\n\\n11. Admissibility of perks including conveyance as well as medical benefits: \\n\\n(1) Admissibility of allowances and benefits while on deputation: Such allowances as are not admissible \\n\\nto regular employees of corresponding grade in IRDAI shall not be admissible to an employee on \\n\\ndeputation, even if they are admissible in the parent organization. \\n\\n(2) The following allowances will be paid as admissible in IRDAI: \\n\\n(a) Transport Allowance \\n\\n(b) Travelling Allowances and Transfer T.A. \\n\\n(c) Children Education Allowance. \\n\\n(3) The following facilities will also be admissible. \\n\\n(a) Joining time - as per parent organization at the time of joining  \\n\\n(b) Joining time pay -  as per IRDAI norms at the time of repatriation if opted for IRDAI pay \\n\\nscales \\n\\n(c) Leave travel concession  as per IRDAI subject to a maximum of two sets in three years \\n\\neven if the employee has unutilized sets to his credit at the time of joining. \\n\\n(4) The following allowances/facilities will be regulated as explained against each: \\n\\n(a)  Dearness allowance  An employee on deputation shall be entitled to dearness allowance \\n\\nat the rates prevailing in IRDAI or in the lending organization depending on the option \\n\\nexercised. \\n\\n(b)  Medical expenses reimbursement - They will be regulated in accordance with the rules of \\n\\nIRDAI. \\n\\n(c) Medical facilities  They will be regulated as per option exercised by the employee on \\n\\ndeputation. \\n\\n(d)Leave - An employee on deputation shall be regulated by the leave rules of the parent \\n\\norganization on the basis of leave earned in IRDAI. However, an employee on deputation \\n\\nshall not be allowed study leave, even if available in the parent organization.  \\n\\n12. Leave salary/GSLI /NPS Contribution: once a year \\n\\n(a) Leave salary contribution (excluding  the period of leave availed of during deputation) and pension \\n\\ncontribution CPF (Employer\\'s share) contribution are required to be paid either by the employee himself \\n\\nor by IRDAI to the parent organization/cadre controlling authority, as the case may be. \\n\\n(b) In case of employees covered under GSLI / New Pension Scheme (NPS), IRDAI shall make matching \\n\\ncontribution to the respective account of the employee/parent organization. \\n\\n13. The Officers on deputation shall not be eligible for the advances and loans applicable to permanent \\n\\nemployees.\\n\\n\\n\\n--- Page 171 ---\\n\\nHkkx III[k.M 4 \\n\\nHkkjr dk jkti=k % vlk/kj.k \\n\\n171 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n14.
